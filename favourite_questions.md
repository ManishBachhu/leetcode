### Leetcode
42. [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/) : Python solution has a beautiful implementation.
138. [Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/) : Map solution is straightforward, but another approach uses the original list to create a mapping between the old and new nodes. Quirky XD.
