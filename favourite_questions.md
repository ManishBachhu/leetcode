### Leetcode
- [Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/) : Good starting point for BST topic. Editorial covers the basic traversal orders really well.
- [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) : Python solution has a beautiful implementation.
- [Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/) : Map solution is straightforward, but another approach uses the original list to create a mapping between the old and new nodes. Quirky XD.
- [Design Bounded Blocking Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-bounded-blocking-queue/) : Real-world application of concurrency concepts.
- [Print Zero Even Odd](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-zero-even-odd/) - Concurrency based problem. Wrote explanation with an elegant solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-zero-even-odd/solutions/5790659/c-beats-100-elegant-solution-with-only-1-mutex-counter);
- [Reverse Bits](leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/) : Solving question without loop is tricky.
- [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/) : Reinforces the idea that binary search means cutting the search space by half.
