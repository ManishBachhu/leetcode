### Leetcode
- [Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/) : Good starting point for BST topic. Editorial covers the basic traversal orders really well.
- [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) : Python solution has a beautiful implementation.
- [Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/) : Map solution is straightforward, but another approach uses the original list to create a mapping between the old and new nodes. Quirky XD.
